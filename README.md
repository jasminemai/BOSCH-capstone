# Capstone Spring 2018: Team 1

The team, made up of **Eduardo Abreu**, **Jasmine Mai**, and **Matthew Schwarz**, will be working on a Calendar Web Application for BOSCH.
### Application
The design of this application is based off of their original calendar application. The calendar web application is an event manager that has admin functionality with a corresponding database. This event manager allows for multiple events to be added, these events could be edited or removed. Events that are added have a tentative status until an administrator approves or denies this event. 

### Technologies
For organization purposes, we used GitHub and ZenHub for version control and documenting our progress. Visual Studio is the IDE we used in order to use C# and the .NET framework to develop. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is used for the front-end along with Bootstrap for styling. All of the data is stored within a local SQL database.

### Challenges & Triumphs
We've encounted many challenges along the way of the development of this project, including difficulties implementing all of the features, such as admin approval and agenda storage. However, we managed to develop an event manager that is supported with a local database.
