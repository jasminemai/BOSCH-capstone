# Capstone Spring 2018: Team 1

The team, made up of **Eduardo Abreu**, **Jasmine Mai**, and **Matthew Schwarz**, will be working on a Calendar Web Application for BOSCH.
### Application
The calendar web application is an event manager that has admin functionality with a corresponding database. This event manager allows for multiple events to be added, these events could be edited or removed. Events that are added have a tentative status until an administrator approves or denies this event. 

### Technologies
For organization purposes, we used GitHub and ZenHub for version control and documenting our progress. We will be using C# and the .NET framework to develop this software for our customer.
