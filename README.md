# Capstone Spring 2018: Team 1

The team, made up of **Eduardo Abreu**, **Jasmine Mai**, and **Matthew Schwarz**, will be working on a Calendar Web Application for BOSCH.

We will be using C# and the .NET framework to develop this software for our customer. 

The Calendar uses the open source JavaScript FullCalendar plugin for displaying events to the user. The plugin can be viewed and downloaded [here](https://fullcalendar.io/).
